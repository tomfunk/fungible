[![CI](https://github.com/tomfunk/fungible/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tomfunk/fungible/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A terminal UI for personal finance. Syncs transactions from Plaid, imports CSVs, and lets you categorize, search, tag, and analyze spending — all from the keyboard.

## Features

- **Plaid sync** — connect bank accounts and pull transactions automatically; 15-min debounce with force-sync option
- **CSV import** — import statement exports from any bank with flexible column mapping
- **Manual assets** — track a house, car, or other asset by name and value
- **Category rules** — substring and regex rules that auto-categorize transactions, with optional amount filters
- **Name rules** — rename how transactions display, with optional amount filters
- **Spending flexibility** — tag categories as fixed / flexible / discretionary; view breakdown on Dashboard
- **Manual edits** — pin a category or display name to a specific transaction; survives re-syncs
- **Ignore** — soft-hide transactions from totals (transfers, reimbursements, etc.)
- **Hidden categories** — exclude categories like Transfer from all totals and charts
- **Tags** — label transactions across accounts (trips, projects, events) and view summaries by tag
- **Net worth** — balance history with asset/liability breakdown; view by account or by type
- **Financial health** — cash and liquid runway, FIRE number and progress, years to retirement with adjustable assumptions
- **Dedup review** — review and remove CSV transactions that duplicate Plaid imports
- **Time ranges** — view Dashboard by week, month, quarter, year, or all time
- **Trends** — month-by-month bar charts for expenses, income, net, or any category; per-range aggregation
- **MCP server** — Claude can read and manage your finances via the Model Context Protocol
- **HTTP API** — REST-style API server for scripting and automation

## Try it (no account needed)

```bash
fungible --demo
```

Spins up a fully pre-loaded instance with fake accounts, transactions, tags, and rules — completely isolated from any real data. Good for exploring all the screens before connecting a bank.

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap tomfunk/fungible
brew install fungible
fungible --setup   # first-time setup wizard
fungible
```

### From source

Requires Node.js 22+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

On first run, use `--setup` to configure credentials:

```bash
npm run dev -- --setup
```

Data and config are stored at `~/.fungible/`. Plaid access tokens are encrypted at rest using a key file at `~/.fungible/key` — do not delete this file or you will need to re-link your bank accounts. You'll need a free [Plaid](https://plaid.com) developer account to sync bank transactions (sandbox tier works).

### Financial Health `[6]`

Displays a full financial picture across four sections:

- **Snapshot** — savings rate (color-coded) and estimated monthly income
- **Runway** — months of cash and liquid coverage at current spending
- **Debt** — net cash position (checking minus credit debt), months to debt-free at current savings rate (hidden if no debt)
- **Retirement** — net worth, FIRE number with progress bar, Coast FIRE (years until growth alone covers retirement if you stop saving now), estimated years to FIRE

| Key | Action |

| `← →` | Adjust selected dial value |
| `r` | Reset selected dial to default |

**Dials:** Monthly spending (±$100, default = avg past 12 months), Monthly savings (±$100, default = avg surplus), Withdrawal rate (±0.5%, default = 4%), Growth rate (±1%, default = 7%).

Liquid assets = cash + brokerage (excludes 401k, IRA, pension).

**Category Rules / Name Rules:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search rules |
| `a` | Add rule |
| `e` / `Enter` | Edit selected rule |
| `d` | Delete selected rule |

Category rules support substring and regex matching with optional min/max amount filters. Name rules support the same matching plus optional amount filters.

**Categories:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a` | Add new category |
| `r` | Rename category (cascades to all transactions, rules, and hidden settings) |
| `d` | Delete category (resets affected transactions to Uncategorized) |
| `h` | Toggle hidden (hidden categories are excluded from totals) |

| `e` | Edit account type / subtype |
| `n` | Set or clear a nickname (shown in place of the bank-assigned name) |
| `v` | Update value (manual assets only) |
| `r` | Repair Plaid link for selected account |
| `s` | Force sync (bypasses 15-min cooldown) |
| `l` | Link a new bank account via Plaid |

**Add Data** options: `[l]` link bank via Plaid, `[c]` import CSV, `[m]` add manual asset (house, car, etc.), `[s]` force sync.

**Dupes** tab shows CSV transactions that match Plaid imports. `[d]` deletes the selected CSV duplicate; `[D]` deletes all.

## Scripts

```bash
# Link a new bank account via Plaid (also available from Accounts screen)
npm run link

# Import a CSV file
npm run import-csv /path/to/file.csv

# Seed default category rules
npm run seed-rules
```

## HTTP API

Exposes the same tools as the MCP server over HTTP — useful for scripting and automation.

```bash
npm run api
# Listening on http://localhost:3456
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /tools/:name` with a JSON body.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/tools/spending_summary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" \
  -d '{"year": 2026, "month": 5}'
```

**Configuration** (in `~/.fungible/.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FUNGIBLE_API_KEY` | _(none)_ | Bearer token required on all requests. If unset, auth is skipped (dev only). |
| `FUNGIBLE_API_PORT` | `3456` | Port to listen on. |

Available tools: same set as the MCP server below.

## MCP Server

Exposes your financial data to Claude via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

```bash
npm run mcp
```

Available tools: `spending_summary`, `list_transactions`, `edit_transaction`, `clear_edit`, `ignore_transaction`, `list_rules`, `add_rule`, `delete_rule`, `list_name_rules`, `add_name_rule`, `delete_name_rule`, `list_hidden_categories`, `toggle_hidden_category`, `list_accounts`, `sync`, `uncategorized_summary`, `list_tags`, `tag_summary`, `tag_transaction`.
